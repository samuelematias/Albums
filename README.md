## About the TripPlanner app development

This app was developed by a Hands on [devPleno](https://www.devpleno.com/) by [Tulio Faria](https://www.devpleno.com/sobre/).<br/>
However, new features and improvements on code and UI were made by [me](https://github.com/samuelmataraso).

## What is this app for? ??

TripPlanner is a app to register your trips and points with your financial costs to be made on the trip.

## Features

- [x] **Add Trip**: You can add your destiny trip by Google Places;
- [x] **List Trips**: Your trips that have been added are listed by a list, stating the location, total travel cost amount and the place chosen on the map by a pin;
- [x] **Add Points on Trip**: You can add the points you want to make during the trip with a description and amount to be spent at that point;

### Next features:

- [ ] **Delete Trip**: You will be able to delete a trip;
- [ ] **Delete Point**: You will be able to delete a point;
- [ ] **Edit Trip**: You will be able to edit a trip;
- [ ] **Edit Point**: You will be able to edit a point;
- [ ] **Archived Trip**: You will be able to archived a trip;

## Tech Stack

- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

## Used libraries

- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler)
- [React Native Google Places](https://github.com/tolu360/react-native-google-places)
- [React Native Maps](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps)
- [React Splash Screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) (Used just for android)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Vanilla Masker](https://github.com/vanilla-masker/vanilla-masker)

<br/>

> Note: Where is the app data being saved 🤨 ? In the phone storage 📲 by AsyncStorage 🔄 🤩.

<br/>

### Running it locally

- `git clone https://github.com/samuelmataraso/TripPlanner.git`
- `yarn`
- `cd ios/ && pod install`
- `react-native link`
- `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`

To open the project on Xcode, use:

- `cd ios/` and look for the file `TripPlanner.xcworkspace`

<br/>

## Final Considerations

I hope you enjoyed the work, this was the first of many jobs to be shared using React Native technology.

I wish I could contribute my knowledge in React Native with open-source projects (libs, projects, etc ...) and with the community as well.

Then you can wait, because more things have been seen!

> Note: Will this app be made available in-store (Apple Store/ Play Store) 🤔 ? perhaps... in the near future (After some improvement, off course 👨‍💻) !
